## Contents
It consists of a multi-modal electrified transportation system topology, an electric power topology, and activity-based use case data that spans transportation as well as charging. The data in this consists of the network (conventional links and electric links that are able to provide conductive charging), demand (routed itinerary demand data), nodes (both conventional nodes and charging nodes), and vehicles (conventional, plug-in EVs, and conductive charging EVs). The electric power topology is not included here, but is available via the URL above.
